// react is having core react algorithm.
// react-dom is library is used to modify the dom. it is a bridge which will connect react with dom.
// react needs a root element where it will do all the dom manipulation and redering.

// createElement in react is a core thing of the react. so it comes from react library.
// but creating a root element and rendering something inside it is job to react-dom library. or we can say creating an element and put it inside dom is job of react-dom. Everything will render inside this root element.

// <div id="root">Hello world!!</div>

const heading = React.createElement(
  "h1",
  { id: "heading", style: { color: "pink"} },
  "Hello world from react!"
);
const root = ReactDOM.createRoot(document.getElementById("root"));
root.render(parent);

what ever we are having in div will be replaced by the element passed in render method.
